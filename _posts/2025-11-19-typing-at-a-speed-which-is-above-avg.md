title: Typing at a Speed Which Is Above Average

I always wanted to type fast, like so fast. Ever since I was little and used computers in my school lab, I was fascinated by it. But for a long time, I didn’t have access to any personal computer or keyboard. And in school, you don’t get to use computers for long, plus they’re usually under a strict teacher’s watch. So, in June 2024, when I finally got access to my first computer, the very first thing I wanted to do was type fast.

But is that really how it works? Nope. You need to know the proper way of typing as well. That’s when I started searching on YouTube, but as we all know, they’re barely useful, and most of the time those so-called tutorials overwhelm us instead of providing any real value. The goal is to type fast, not to watch others typing fast.

So, after a lot of trial and error and taking typing tests on many sites, I finally found two sites that are actually useful (and belive me, those are only the sites someone needs along with a keyboard):

**1st one is,**

- [edclub.com](https://www.edclub.com/library/typing-jungle)

Their Typing Jungle is where I learned how to type properly using all ten fingers and without looking at the keyboard.

**& another site is,**

- [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/)

Here I practice.

After a few months of practice, I finally found myself at a pace where I can say I’m typing at a speed that is above average.
Right now, my goal is to type at an average speed of **150 WPM**, and for that, I practice on Monkeytype (English 450K, punctuation & numbers turned on).

### Things to Keep in Mind

- Don’t ever look at the keyboard while typing. That’s literally step one if you want to be fast.

- When you're typing with all ten fingers, you'll make a lot of mistakes, and it might feel weird at first. But, that's one of the best and most effective ways to learn. With two or four fingers, you can’t go beyond a certain speed (usually around 40 WPM), but with ten fingers, you can.

- When you take typing tests for the first time, it’s okay to get 20, 15, or even 9 WPM! The only thing you should care about right now is **accuracy**. Make sure it never drops below 95%. My preference would be to aim for 100% accuracy in your initial days.

- Don’t get disappointed. You probably don’t realize how much speed you can achieve if you stay consistent, you’ll be mind-blown!

All the best! If you're curious about my speed right now, my best is **112 WPM** (in a normal English words 10 test, no punctuation and numbers enabled), and my average is around **75 WPM**.

The keyboard I use is [Zebronics K20](https://www.amazon.in/Zebronics-ZEB-K20-USB-Keyboard-Rupee/dp/B07KX9V8J4) (cost me around ₹250).

My aim isn’t to show how fast I type (actually I do 🫢 - [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiXlmjDi6Bk)), but to guide you with only what you truly need to **type fast**. It’s a skill, and it also looks really cool!

So stop watching endless videos. Just start typing. All you need is a keyboard and the willingness to type.
