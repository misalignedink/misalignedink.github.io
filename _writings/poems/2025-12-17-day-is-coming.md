<div class="poem-text-wrapper">

When sun is rising, birds are singing, <br/>
I'm waking. <br/> <br/>

When mind is refreshing, body feels warming, <br/>
I'm daydreaming. <br/> <br/>

When hands are scrolling, dopamine is flowing, <br/>
I'm distracting. <br/> <br/>

When today is ending, tomorrow never seeing, <br/>
I'm panicking. <br/> <br/>

When time is passing, again it's failing, <br/>
I'm crying. <br/> <br/>

When cycle is keep going, break is not stopping, <br/>
I'm thinking. <br/> <br/>

When thinking is not working, action is everything, <br/>
Mind is realising, <br/>
<em><b>Impossible is nothing.</b></em> <br/> <br/>

When density is increasing, gravity is hardening, <br/>
Photons are not trying, <br/>
<em><b>Darkness is appearing.</b></em> <br/> <br/>

When sense is not making, night must going, <br/>
Dawn is approaching, <br/>
<em><b>Soul is awakening.</b></em> <br/> <br/>

When pen is walking, thoughts are running, <br/>
Hand is writing, <br/>
<em><b>Day is coming, the day of winning.</b></em>
